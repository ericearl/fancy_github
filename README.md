# F-R-E-E as in Free: A Brief Guide to some GitHub Repository Tools

A repository to teach about the utility of some of GitHub's unique suite of free tools within repositories: Issues, Milestones, Projects, Wiki, and Discussions.

## GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues is a great place to go for collecting everything from bugs to enhancements (a.k.a. feature requests) to planned documentation updates and anything in-between.  Adding small and specific details while you remember them can prove critical to not forgetting a small feature or bug mentioned or discovered in passing.  Using Issues leads to better quality code.  In a GitHub Issue you should have...

### At A Minimum

1. **Title**: Use something concise, but descriptive so if the team has many Issues filed it will be easy to tell what the issues are at a glance of the titles.
2. **Comment**: Write something specific and detailed.  Common things to include are the specific description, exactly how to reproduce it (if it's a bug), and other details that matter.  Add as much detail as possible without veering off track from the exact Issue.  If you are experiencing multiple issues, separate them so each Issue is clearly defined and contained.

### If Possible

1. **Assignees**: Assign/pick someone(s) to work on the Issue.  If they don't feel it is meant for them then they can always assign someone else and unassign themselves.
2. **Labels**: Add Labels to make it clear whether this Issue relates to documentation, bugs in the repository, documentation, or combinations of the above.  You can make any labels you like if they do not already exist in the repository.  I like to add priority labels to all my repositories so people know where the Issue's priority has been set.
3. **Projects**: Associate the Issue to a GitHub Project.  Projects will be covered lower in the README, but for now just know that you can associate Issues to Projects (looks like a Kanban board/task card list).
4. **Milestones**: Assign an Issue to a Milestone.  This way you know what version or release or set of Issues belong together.  When the collection of issues that go together are done, you get to see the Milestone complete too!

## GitHub Milestones

Which brings us to GitHub Milestones.  Milestones is a GitHub feature for tracking multiple Issues that belong together or are prerequisites for some release or belong to one feature.  With Milestones you can track your progress to completion visually as collections of Issues.  You can set as many or as few Milestones as you like.  My preference is to have one Milestone per four of five issues to culminate in a specific version release (hotfix, minor, or major, visit [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for more info).  I feel like if something is on the overarching roadmap conceptually, it deserves to have a Milestone.

## GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects is a wonderful GitHub addition to organize your tasks arbitrarily using a Kanban-style board of notes (a.k.a. cards).  You can set as many or as few columns as you like with as many notes as you like and be as specific or as general as you like.  You can even quickly convert a note to an Issue (or vice versa from an Issue).  My minimum personal preference is for three columns: **To do**, **In progress**, and **Done (yay!)** that a team of two or more people are responsible for keeping up-to-date.  I sometimes like to add a **Backlog** column if the **To do** column becomes too large.  Then you can move **Backlog** notes off to Issues and remove them from the active Project.  Since you can have many projects as well, I find it nice to lump only as many notes into the Project as might take a month or so to complete.  This way your Project board doesn't get old and become stale or unused.  It can also be used for specific feature sprints in this way.

## GitHub Wiki

When you would like to add more than a README, but don't need to publish a whole documentation website about it, a nice middle ground is a GitHub repository Wiki.  The Wiki, like each of the other features talked about here, is specific to this repository.  My favorite way of using a Wiki is to document something very specific that may take more than a few paragraphs, but is self-contained as a topic.  Pictures are also important for demonstration in a Wiki page.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading or listening.  Feel free to explore this repository and add all the Issues, Milestones, Projects, and Wiki pages you like which you feel would help explain these GitHub features!
